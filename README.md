# NRF24-SHIM project

My NRF24-SHIM (mini-HAT) for Raspberry Pi project.

This project came to reality when I was looking for a way to connect standard NRF24L01+ module to my Pi.
I had found many tutorials explaining how to connect NRF24 modules to Pi but no ready made board or even proper schematics.
"Hmm... DIY!" I told myself and here we are.

## NRF24-SHIM

Raspberry Pi 40-pin **NRF24-SHIM** mini-HAT.

Pins Configuration:

|NRF24 Pin|Option 1|Option 2|
|---------|--------|--------|
|CE       |GPIO22\*|GPIO25  |
|CSN      |GPIO8\* |GPIO18  |
|SCK      |GPIO11\*|GPIO21  |
|MOSI     |GPIO10\*|GPIO20  |
|MISO     |GPIO9\* |GPIO19  |
|IRQ      |GPIO23  |GPIO24  |

\*) the pin is connected by default.
